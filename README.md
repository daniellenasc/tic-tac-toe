# Tic-Tac-Toe

## About the game
'Tic-tac-toe' (American English), 'noughts and crosses' (Commonwealth English), or 'Xs and Os' (Irish English) is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with ‚ùå or ‚≠ï. 
The player who succeeds in placing _three_ of their marks in a _horizontal_, _vertical_, or _diagonal_ row is the **winner**!

ü§ìFun-fact: an early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called _terni lapilli_ (three pebbles at a time) and the game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome.
